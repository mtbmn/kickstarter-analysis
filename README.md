# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### The purpose of this project is twofold. The first objective was to determine which months were the best timeframe to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a theater. The second objective was to determine the success or failure rates of Kickstarter campaigns for plays based on their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
### To determine which month was the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for a theater we created a Pivot Table in Excel to display our results in charts and graphs. We narrowed the data down to theater campaigns and further divided the data into the months the campaign was established and whether or not it was successful. This established a count and enabled a graphical visualization to be created.![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88675415/134815384-2040139c-8a58-4c13-9203-060fa474550f.png)
### To determine the success and failure rates of Kickstarter campaigns for plays based on funding objectives we created a chart laying out ranges of funding objectives in the chart rows and whether or not the projects were successful, failed or canceled in the columns. The data composing the body of the chart was populated via COUNTIFs formulas pulling the requisite values from the bulk data. This allowed us to create and populate columns for Total # of Projects and Percentage Successful, Failed or Canceled. The completion of the chart enabled the creation of a visual representation in the form of a graph.![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88675415/134815707-bb9204f7-92d0-4f58-8fd3-97630dea39b6.png)
### Challenges and difficulties: In the Outcomes Based on Goals tab we had difficulty populating the data via the COUNTIFS formulas. We knew the objective and where the data was to be pulled from yet had issues develop regarding commas and spacing in order to make the formula work.
## Results
### Conclusion of Theater Outcomes by Launch Date: 1. The best month to start a Kickstarter campaign for a theater is May. June is a close second. The number of successful campaigns declines as the year progresses toward December. 2. The count of failed Kickstarter campaigns remains relatively consistent throughout the year without a large peak or valley with respect to a particular month. This pattern also holds true for canceled campaigns.
### Conclusion of Outcomes Based on Goals: The rates at which a Kickstarter campaign for plays are successful based on funding objectives begins to decline as the funding objective increases. This trend reverses at the funding objective of $30,000 and the campaigns become more successful. After an objective of $45,000 there is a steep decline in success rate. 
### Limitations on the data set: There is not information on how the Kickstarter campaigns are marketed. Were the originators of the campaigns active in pursuit of their objectives or were they more passive? How much effort was applied to meet the objectives of the campaigns?
### Other table and graph possibilities: An interesting chart and graph to create would be success rate based on the country in which the campaign was started. Another interesting possibility would be success rate based on average donation size.
